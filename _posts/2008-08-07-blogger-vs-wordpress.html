I used to write a private WordPress blog and I was contemplating mapping it to my shiny new domain to kick it off.
<br /><br />
However the following comparison clearly shows why I switched to Blogger instead:
<br /><br />
Wordpress - <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2006/10/24/domain-mapping-registration/">$10/year</a><br />Blogger - Free
<br /><br />
It's that simple. Yes, I'm cheap.
