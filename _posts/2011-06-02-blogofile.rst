Inspired by my friend OJ_, I've decided to make the switch to Blogofile.
I guess I have too much time on my hands.

There isn't much I can say on this subject that hasn't already been_ said_.
This_ script came in handy to convert my Blogger posts across.

My biggest hurdle was finding a new host *and* being a complete cheapskate.
I couldn't seem to find a free and simple HTML site. I started to think
about Dropbox, until I realised that they don't respect index.html files.
Fortunately someone_ had a neat idea - host it on GitHub_!

One thing would have been *nice* is a selection of out-the-box themes;
but completely understandable that there isn't.
In the meantime I ported my current Blogger theme_, which was surprisingly
painless.

I'll probably be tweaking bits-and-pieces of the site in the next few weeks,
like a child playing with a new toy. Procrastinating instead of, say,
writing new blog posts.
