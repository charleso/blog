My Github profile is, like many people I suspect, largely made up of forked
repositories to send one or two patches up-stream.
This list is more representative of software I've actively worked on as a
primary contributor or creator.


## [hedgehog](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/scala-hedgehog) (_scala_)

**Status**: active

Hedgehog is a modern property-based testing system, in the spirit of [QuickCheck]
(and [ScalaCheck]). Hedgehog uses integrated shrinking, so shrinks obey the
invariants of generated values by construction.

[QuickCheck]: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck
[ScalaCheck]: https://www.scalacheck.org/


## [bantam](https://github.com/charleso/bantam) (_haskell_)

**Status**: stable

The service for helping running the annual [fp-syd][fp-syd] [Coq]-fight, hosted
at [bantam.ouroborus.net](http://bantam.ouroborus.net/).

[Coq]: https://coq.inria.fr/
[fp-syd]: http://fp-syd.ouroborus.net/


## [git-cc](https://github.com/charleso/git-cc) (_python_)

**Status**: inactive

Simple bridge between base [ClearCase] and [Git] in the spirit of [git-svn].

[ClearCase]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_ClearCase
[Git]: https://git-scm.com/
[git-svn]: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-svn
