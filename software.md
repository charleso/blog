My Github profile is, like many people I suspect, largely made up of forked
repositories to send one or two patches up-stream.
This list is more representative of software I've actively worked on as a
primary contributor or creator.


## [Hedgehog](https://github.com/hedgehogqa/scala-hedgehog) (_scala_)

**Status**: active

Hedgehog is a modern property-based testing system, in the spirit of QuickCheck
(and ScalaCheck). Hedgehog uses integrated shrinking, so shrinks obey the
invariants of generated values by construction.


## [bantam](https://github.com/charleso/bantam) (_haskell_)

**Status**: stable

The service for helping running the annual [fp-syd] Coq-fight, hosted
at [bantam.ouroborus.net](http://bantam.ouroborus.net/).

## [git-cc](https://github.com/charleso/git-cc) (_python_)

**Status**: inactive

Simple bridge between base ClearCase or UCM and Git in the spirit of [git-svn].
