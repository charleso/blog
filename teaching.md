Over the years I've worked on or extended various training material for teaching
various concepts.



## [FP in Scala](https://github.com/charleso/introduction-to-fp-in-scala)

Originally created by [markhibberd](https://github.com/markhibberd/introduction-to-fp-in-scala),
I have forked his excellent version to include more extensive testing coverage.


## [Git](https://github.com/charleso/git-training)

Intended to teach the internals of Git with self-directed material.


## [Haskell](https://github.com/charleso/haskell-in-haste)

Intended to be used to teach people Haskell by building something practical
in a short amount of time.
